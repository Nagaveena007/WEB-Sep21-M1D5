 Write a function called "crazyDiff" that computes the absolute difference between a given number and 19.
 It should return triple their absolute difference if the given number is greater than 19.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 4
 Write a function called "boundary" which accept an integer parameter n and returns true if n is within 20 and 100 (included) or if n it's equal to 400.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 5
 Write a function called "strivify" which accepts a string as a parameter.
 It should add the word "Strive" in front of the given string, but if the given string already begins with "Strive", then it should just return the original string.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 7
 Write a function called "reverseString" which programmatically reverses a given string (es.: Strive => evirtS).
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 8
 Write a function called "upperFirst" which capitalizes the first letter of each word of a given string passed as a parameter.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 9
 Write a function called "cutString" which creates a new string without the first and last character of a given string passed as a parameter.
*/

/* WRITE YOUR ANSWER HERE */

/* EXERCISE 10
